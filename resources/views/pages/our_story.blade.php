                           <p>Before being a Co-Founder of an IT Company, a proud mother of two kids, an educationist and an entrepreneur,  I am a big time optimistic person who dares to believe.

                           <p>Everyone will certainly agree with the fact that a  disciplined routine and healthy lifestyle makes you happier, healthier and efficient. This thought and the frequency of the surging health cases instigated me to turn my vision into reality. </p>
